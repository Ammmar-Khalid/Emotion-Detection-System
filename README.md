# Emotion-Detection-System
In today's technologically advanced world, emotion detection systems play a vital role in various applications, from healthcare to entertainment. These systems facilitate the interpretation of human emotions through facial expressions, enabling more natural interactions between humans and machines. A key component in the implementation of such systems is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and classification.

Emotion detection from facial expressions involves several steps, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, and real-time prediction. Each step requires careful consideration to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the system. The increasing availability of large datasets and advancements in deep learning have made it possible to develop systems that can detect emotions with high accuracy.

Our emotion detection project aims to develop a scalable application using CNNs and OpenCV. The primary goal of the project is to establish a reliable and efficient system that can accurately detect emotions in real-time. By leveraging pre-trained models and the power of OpenCV, the application can perform tasks such as real-time video analysis and emotion classification. Additionally, the project emphasizes the importance of preprocessing steps, including image normalization and face detection, to improve model accuracy.
